The Windows version of this build currently does not work.
The following refers to the 64-bit Linux version.

Library dependancies:
	libz
	
The extconf.rb file for this extension assumes the extension is being built from the source tree, and that
the required NetApp headers and libraries are available in their directory of that tree.

If the extension is in:
	miq/lib/NetappManageabilityAPI/NmaCore/NmaCore_raw
	
Then the base directory for the NetApp headers and libraries must be:
	netapp-manageability-sdk/netapp-manageability-sdk-4.0P1
	
Where miq and netapp-manageability-sdk have the same parent directory.

To build the extension from this directory:

	ruby extconf.rb
	make
	
NOTE: In order to build an extension that will run on an appliance, the ruby used to run the extconf.rb should be ree for ruby1.8.7 or ruby 1.9.3.
	
This should generate NmaCore_raw.so in this directory. This shared object should be moved to the appropriate directory based on the platform/ruby.
For example: NmaCore/lib/x86_64-linux/ruby1.9.3/NmaCore_raw.so.  This library is loaded via the NmaCore_raw.rb based on the platform and directory.

NOTE: The current version of the extension is checked into the source tree and should run on all target
Linux appliances.

On the runtime system, the NetApp libraries need to be made available. Assuming the system is 64-bit Linux,
the libraries are in:

	netapp-manageability-sdk/netapp-manageability-sdk-4.0P1/lib/linux-64
	
On the runtime system:

	mkdir -p /usr/local/netapp-manageability-sdk/lib
	cp netapp-manageability-sdk/netapp-manageability-sdk-4.0P1/lib/linux-64/* /usr/local/netapp-manageability-sdk/lib
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/netapp-manageability-sdk/lib
	
On RedHat and CentOS, the following is required:

	ln -s /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8e /lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8
	ln -s /lib64/libcrypto.so.0.9.8e /lib64/libcrypto.so.0.9.8

	ln -s /lib/libssl.so.0.9.8e /lib/libssl.so.0.9.8
	ln -s /lib64/libssl.so.0.9.8e /lib64/libssl.so.0.9.8
